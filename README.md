## Description
###### First Screen
The breeds list returned from the API are presented in an expandable list. Breeds with sub-breeds allows the user to expand the section (arrow tap) to see all sub-breeds.
When user clicks on a breed name, a second fragment is called in order to show the pictures of this breed.
###### Second Screen
A list of 10 random pictures are presented in the screen (some breeds have less of 10 pictures available, in this cases I show only the number available)
